# Understanding Spring, IoC, and REST in the Context of My Task Management Backend

## üìå Overview of the Project

This project is a **Spring Boot-based backend** for a Task Management application. It provides a clean and well-structured RESTful API that allows users to **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** tasks. The backend is containerized with Docker and connected to a MySQL database for persistent storage. Swagger is also integrated.

## üå± What is Spring?

**Spring** is a powerful, lightweight framework used for building Java-based applications. It simplifies enterprise application development by providing infrastructure support like dependency injection, transaction management, web development tools, and more.

In this project, **Spring Boot**, a module of the Spring ecosystem, is used to:
- Quickly bootstrap the backend with minimal configuration.
- Auto-configure components and dependencies.
- Expose RESTful APIs.
- Handle database operations via Spring Data JPA.

## üîÅ Inversion of Control (IoC) in the Project

**Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a core principle of Spring that reverses the flow of control. Instead of the application creating dependencies manually, Spring manages and injects them where needed.

### Example in This Project:
```java
@Service
public class TaskService {
    private final TaskRepository taskRepository;

    @Autowired
    public TaskService(TaskRepository taskRepository) {
        this.taskRepository = taskRepository;
    }
}

Here, Spring injects the TaskRepository dependency into TaskService.

This promotes loose coupling, making the application easier to maintain and test.

Understanding REST in the Project
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style used for designing networked applications. In this project, REST principles are applied to create a clean API for task management.

REST Endpoints in This App:
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/tasks	Retrieve all tasks
GET	/api/tasks/{id}	Retrieve task by ID
POST	/api/tasks	Create a new task
PUT	/api/tasks/{id}	Update an existing task
DELETE	/api/tasks/{id}	Delete a task by ID



RESTful Features Used:
Stateless communication: Each request contains all necessary information.

HTTP methods: Used according to their intended purposes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Resource-based URIs: Clear and predictable endpoint naming.

JSON format: Used for request and response bodies.


Conclusion
This Spring Boot project demonstrates a practical use of the Spring framework, leveraging IoC for clean architecture and REST for well-structured APIs. It forms the backend foundation for a full-fledged task management system, ready for integration with any frontend or mobile client.
